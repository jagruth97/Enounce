thank you for that warm introduction
let me first welcome the graduating flowers and are extended family
let me acknowledge
parent grandparent
and relative except for those who for some reason did not give us any graduation money
Royal friends
accept those to whom we own money
and finally teachers and administrators who are constantly borrowing money
please stop
certainly a parents have a lot to be proud of
just think parent in a few months many of us will be going off to college or getting a job
and you get what you been waiting for a long time
to turn that now empty bedroom into a home office
